## üí≠ The Concept:

The Cage Page is a silly idea that has grown more and more. 
The concept was simple to begin with:
- A group of friends and I wanted to watch all of the worst movies
staring `Nic Cage`
- These movies were occasionally unbearable, so we were force to drink heavily
- There was no established drinking games for any of these movies, since a good deal of them never saw the flicker of a movie theatre projector

## ‚òëÔ∏è The Features:
- (Currently) 6 different endpoints to interact with the functionality of the app:
  - Index: Get all movies (starring Nic Cage, of course)
  - Detail: Get one movie by ID
  - Add to Watchlist: Add the movie to your watch list
  - Rules: Get all rules for a given movie
  - Add Rule: Create a new rule
  - Toast: Give a rule a toast, showing your affection


## üìã The Process:
- The app was initially built on the Express framework using Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database. The app began to develop the need for a more advanced front-end, so React was added to the existing backend. With the file structure becoming bloated by legacy code and a new front-end, the two were separated for better organization, and ease of deployment. The backend is currently deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, and S3 Buckets for static assets.

## üîÆ The Future:
In no order of priority, this is what I'm working to add to The Cage Page:
- Improved User Dashboard:
  - See engagement on rules
  - See total rules
- Rule reviews:
  - "this rule was too strong"
  - "this never happens"
  - etc
